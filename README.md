Passionate about building scalable and efficient web systems with modern technologies. I work daily with stacks like Node.js, Ruby, Vue.js, React, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and AWS.

Driven by curiosity, Iâ€™m always exploring how software can solve real-world problems with clarity and performance. I believe that consistent learning and strong fundamentals make a difference in both code and impact.

In my spare time, I'm developing an MVP of a flashcard app that uses *spaced repetition* to optimize long-term memory retention.
